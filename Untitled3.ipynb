You will have to decide the data preprocessing (if any) and the clustering algorithm. You can use scientific computing libraries (e.g. NumPy / SciPy) for both processing (for example PCA) and clustering (for example KMeans), and you can use any functions you developed in your previous homeworks.\n",
